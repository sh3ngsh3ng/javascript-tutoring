    <p>
        DOM is also known as Document Object Model. <br>
        It is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. <br>
        it represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content <br>
        The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. <br>
        That way, programming language (javascript) can connect to the page<br>
